UW CODING BOOTCAMP - MODULE ONE CHALLENGE - HORISEON WEBSITE

This project was to update the html code with modern semantics removing all of the old div elements. 
I also went through the css and consolidated all of the redundant code making it A:easier to read, and B: more streamlined so it is easier to update in the future. 

To use this webpage you can scroll through and read the information just as any other webpage. If you click on the menu items at the top, they will take you to the spot on the page that has information regarding those menu item categories.
